                    <h2>Analysis And Business Requirements.</h2>
                    <p>
                        Business requirements are gathered in this     phase. This phase is the main focus of the project managers and stake holders. Meetings with managers, stake holders and users are held in order to determine the requirements like; Who is going to use the system? How will they use the system?  What data should be input into the system?  What data should be output by the system?  These are general questions that get answered during a requirements gathering phase. After requirement gathering these requirements are analyzed for their validity and the possibility of incorporating the requirements in the system to be development is also studied.
                        <br><br>
                        Finally, a Requirement Specification document is created which serves the purpose of guideline for the next phase of the model.

                    <h2>Prototyping And Designing</h2>
                    <p>
                        In this phase the system and software design is prepared from the requirement specifications which were studied in the first phase. System Design helps in specifying hardware and system requirements and also helps in defining overall system architecture. The system design specifications serve as input for the next phase of the model.

                    <h2>Coding And Development</h2>
                    <p>
                        On receiving system design documents, the work is divided in modules/units and actual coding is started. Since, in this phase the code is produced so it is the main focus for the developer. This is the longest phase of the software development life cycle.

                    <h2>Testing And Checking</h2>
                    <p>
                        After the code is developed it is tested against the requirements to make sure that the product is actually solving the needs addressed and gathered during the requirements phase. During this phase unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing are done.

                    <h2>Deployment and Maintenance</h2>
                    <p>
                        After successful testing the product is delivered / deployed to the customer for their use.
                        <br><br>
                        Once when the customers starts using the developed system then the actual problems comes up and needs to be solved from time to time. This process where the care is taken for the developed product is known as maintenance.
